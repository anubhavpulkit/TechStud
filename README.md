This iOS-application contains a list of open source events and hackathons that are happening around the world. They are in a proper month wise timeline so the user does not face difficulty while searching through the open source events. Most of the times students want to participate in the events but they dont know the dates or the event details. This iOS-Application contains links of the events and when are the events going to take place.
